# Calculator-Express-Nodemon
A basic interactive calculator with express and nodemon. 
You will need to install to the VScode terminal

  1. npm init
  2. npm install express
  3. npm i -g nodemon
  4. nodemon server.js for it to work with your project file
  5. npm i body-parser
  
  The only issue I had was getting nodemon to work as I had to go to stackoverflow to find the answer, for which I had to go to my windows,
    go to settings 
    >> update and security 
    >> for developers 
    >> check the box beside change execution policy and and press apply to allow local powershell scripts to run without signing. Nodeman automates all he prcessess which is really cool. If you have any issues then pkease head over to stackoverflow which is a really cool site to get answers or you could message me on my <a href="https://twitter.com/nftcryptomix">twitter handle</a> for further advice.
